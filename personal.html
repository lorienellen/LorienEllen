                <h3>Creative, Analytical, Courageous, Goal Oriented, ADHD. Personality Type: INFJ</h3>
                <p>My name is Lorien Gugich. I'm a free spirited 33 year old who is passionate about living life authentically, always striving for what's next.
                    I advocate for inclusivity, while creating more awareness around mental health and neurodiversity. My personality type is INFJ.<br><br>
                    I live in Hawke's Bay, New Zealand with my child and our beloved pets. Some of which are our English Bulldog "Chorizo", our Axolotl "Sunny", and our Dove "Marshmallow".
                    Currently I am studying a Bachelor of Computing Systems to upskill in my career, which is the reason for this website (it's part of my course!).<br><br>

                <h1>Guitar</h1>
                <p>On New Years Day 2024 I decided that I would finally pick up Guitar, after having always wanted to try it. I knew that I needed to pick a guitar that would make me <i>want</i> to keep playing,
                    so I chose a Fender Player Stratocaster in Buttercream (yellow)!<br><br>
                    I started self-directed lessons through a paid mobile application, and stuck at it! I learned the chords fairly quickly, and my confidence grew. I began to share posts of my
                    progress on social media, including video's of me singing while playing! I wanted to further improve, so I put some feelers out there to join a local jam group. Shortly after
                    that, I was invited to perform at The Paisley Stage in Napier. I had a 15 minute slot where I sang and played three songs infront of a live audience. It was certainly a night to remember,
                    and I hope to do it again.<br><br>
                    I have a deep appreciation for how music has shaped my life, and continues to.
